When building web applications with Ruby on Rails, it is of great importance that you get familiar with the most important _Rails Command Line Commands_ that you are going to using almost in all projects.

There are a few commands that are absolutely critical to your everyday usage of Rails. In the order of how much I use them are:

- rails console
- rails server
- rake
- rails generate
- rails generate
- rails new app_name


## My Favorite Usage

##### rails new you_app_name

Use this command in the terminal in a directory where you want create your new rails application.

{% highlight rails %}
rails new your_app_name
{% endhighlight %}
