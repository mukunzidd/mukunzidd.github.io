<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">H</span>appy new year my friends. This is the beginning of a new year and we have to keep on hacking. What I mean by that is to never stop. Never stop learning, never stop building projects, never stop coding. It may be true that you struggle a lot to get a grasp on different important objects, but it's the only way to go.</p>

As you code along, you will get frustrated, you will get stuck, you will write thousands of bugs, but the important thing is to keep going. 

Have you ever heard of Pomodoro Clock?... Stay tuned for February episodes for the **_Pomodoro_** technique of learning and some good **_ruby series_**.

_Keep on hacking!_
