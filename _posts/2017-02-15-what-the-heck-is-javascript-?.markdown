<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat the heck is javascript? Is it a kid of JAVA or a sibling? Or is it JAVA in the browser?. If you are like me, you have asked yourself these questions alot. Let's clear the sky on that in a few words.</p>

*Javascript* is a programming language that brwosers understands. All it does is making webpages aka websites interactive. 

When you view a slideshow or get an annoying popup advertisement – that my friend, is JavaScript. If you see your _*Twitter Feed*_ update or _*Google autocomplete*_ a search term – that also is JavaScript.

When a webpage changes without you clicking a thing (a link, a button, etc) – that is JavaScript at work!

JavaScript is one of the few programming languages that can be run in your browser. Because of it has been developed in only ten 10 dyas and how easy it was to learn, for many years back in the days, it was dismissed by professionals as being _a toy for amateurs_.

But all of a sudden, all of the bad ideas about JavaScript changed around ten years ago with the advent of *“AJAX”* and *“Web 2.0.”* These were sets of technologies that used JavaScript in a whole new innovative ways, allowing the Web to be way more interactive than it had been before. So next time you use a Google Spreadsheet or watch a Tweet update on a web page, you can know what’s going on – that’s JavaScript!

Cocktail Party Fact
You might have heard of ‘Java,’ but that’s actually a completely different language. It came out around the same time as JavaScript, and they only share a name thanks to a marketing scheme! The joke goes “Java is to Javascript what Car is to Carpet.”

JavaScript’s fancy real name is ECMAScript, but you should only call it that when you’re angry that it hasn’t done its dishes.
