    <p>It's been about two years now, that I've been teaching myself how to code, and it's always going to stay that way.</p>


  <h2>Present</h2>

    <p>I am taking part in a training by <a href="http://http://anyonecanlearntocode.com/" target="_blank">Actualize Bootcamp</a> that is taking place in Kigali, Rwanda.</p>

    <p>Well, you may think I lied about teaching myself how to code, but it is true that a good programmer is a learner himself. We will be spending 12 weeks straight with our instructor <a href="http://markeban.com/" target="_blank">Mark</a> who is doing a great job at getting us ready to be the best we've ever been.</p>


  <h2>Future</h2>

   <p>For now, let's keep on hacking! But I plan to stack a YouTube Show, so my blog post will have a full video taking you step by step on how to be better programmers.</p>
